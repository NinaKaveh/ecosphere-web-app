        <p>Ecosphere is a website, more exactly a blog. It should allow registered users to publish articles related to
            the environment.
            These articles can be published by professionals as well as individuals.
            Their reading will be open to registered members of the ecosphere blog as well as visitors to the website.
            The aim is to allow people to take an interest in the environment by reading articles for free and thus,
            perhaps, to have the desire to publish an article on this blog to defend their point of view on the
            environment.
            This website is therefore a way to defend these convictions as well as to share with as many people as
            possible the beauties of this world that are in danger today.</p>
