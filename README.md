# Ecosphere Web App

This is the participative platform, Ecosphere, with which students and employees of ISEP, a digital engineering school, will be able to follow environmental news and hence play a role, at their own level, in a context of ecological transition.

This project aims to increase the number of participants in events related to ecology, and more generally to sustainable development.

The platform will guarantee a permanent reliability with information coming from members of the school, and will be controlled by an administrator.

The aim is that the platform will be entertaining, by letting members contribute to the flow of information themselves, while challenging its members with a system of trophies for each relevant publication or participation.

In addition, the platform is dedicated to track COVID-19 news. You will be able to follow the evolution of the pandemic with the help of published statistics.

## Our team
We are a team of three ISEP students. This platform is a challenge for us, allowing us to show our skills in design, development and deployment of web applications.

Our name: The Witcher, in reference to the famous suite of novels by Andrzej Sapkowski.
