        <h3 class="question"> How to win xp on our profile ? </h3>
        <p class="reponse">
            The xp system is linked to the article system. Indeed, there a two ways to win xp. The first is by
            publishing articles (they need to be relevant otherwise an admin will delete it and you will receive no
            points). Then, once the article is published, people adding a like to your article will make you win some
            xp. In other way, the best way to have a lot of xp is to be active on the platform and to publish articles
            that other users will like.
