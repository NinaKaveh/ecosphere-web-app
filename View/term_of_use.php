            assigns, and waive and release us from any and all past, present and future disputes, claims, controversies,
            demands, rights, obligations, liabilities, actions and causes of action of any kind and nature whatsoever
            which arise or result directly or indirectly from or in connection with the Site. If you are a California
            resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542 in connection with the foregoing, which states: "A
            general release does not extend to claims that the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her
            favor at the time of execution of the release, which, if known to him or her, must have materially affected
            his or her settlement with the debtor. "

    <div>
        <h2>Warnings</h2>
        <p>The site is provided "as is" and "as available", and the company and our suppliers expressly disclaim all
            warranties and conditions of any kind, whether express, implied or statutory, including all warranties or
            conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, accuracy or
            non-infringement. We and our suppliers do not warrant that the site will meet your requirements, be
            available on an uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free basis, or be accurate, reliable, free of viruses
            or other harmful code, complete, legal, or secure. If applicable law requires warranties with respect to the
            Site, all such warranties are limited in duration to ninety (90) days from the date of first use.
        </p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to
            you. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above
            limitation may not apply to you.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Company or our suppliers be liable to you or
            any third party for any lost profits, lost data, costs of procurement of substitute products, or any
            indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages arising out of or in connection
            with these Terms or your use or inability to use the Site even if the Company has been advised of the
            possibility of such damages. Access to and use of the Site is at your sole discretion and risk, and you will
            be solely responsible for any damage to your computer device or system, or loss of data resulting therefrom.
        </p>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, our
            liability to you for any damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall at all times be limited
            to a maximum of fifty United States dollars (US$50). The existence of multiple claims will not extend this
            limit. You agree that our suppliers shall have no liability whatsoever arising out of or relating to this
            Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential
            damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Term and Termination:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Subject to this section, these Terms and Conditions will remain in full force and effect while you use the
            Site. We may suspend or terminate your rights to use the Site at any time for any reason in our sole
            discretion, including for any use of the Site in violation of these Terms. Upon termination of your rights
            under these Terms, your account and your right to access and use the Site will terminate immediately. You
            understand that any termination of your account may involve the removal of your user content associated with
            your account from our live databases. The Company shall have no liability to you for any termination of your
            rights under these Terms. Even after the termination of your rights under these Terms, the following
            provisions of these Terms will remain in effect: Sections 2 to 2.5, Section 3 and Sections 4 to 10.

        <h2>Copyright policy.</h2>
        <p>The company respects the intellectual property of others and asks users of our site to do the same. As part
            of our site, we have adopted and implemented a policy that complies with copyright law that provides for the
            removal of all infringing material and the termination of users of our online site who are repeat infringers
            of intellectual property rights, including copyrights. If you believe that one of our users is unlawfully
            infringing the copyright(s) of a work through our Site and you wish to have the allegedly infringing
            material removed, the following information in the form of written notification (in accordance with 17 USC §
            512(c)) must be provided to our designated copyright agent:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
            <li>identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim has been infringed;</li>
            <li>Identification of the material on our services that you claim has been infringed and that you request us
                to remove;
            </li>
            <li>information sufficient to permit us to locate the material;</li>
            <li>your address, telephone number and e-mail address;</li>
            <li>a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the objectionable material in the manner
                complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
            </li>
            <li>and a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that
                you
                are either the owner of the copyright that is allegedly infringed or that you are authorized to act on
                the copyright owner's behalf.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Please note that, pursuant to 17 USC § 512 (f), any material misrepresentation of fact in a written
            notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for all damages, costs, and
            attorneys' fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and the alleged copyright
            infringement.
