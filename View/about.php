    <div id="history">
        <p>Our team was born in 2019. It was created at the same time as the EcoSphere project.
            It brings together three students from ISEP, a digital engineering school.
            This project is then a study project in BAC+4 in the field of IS architecture.</p>

        <h2>The team</h2>
        <p>Each person's two educational backgrounds allow the team to carry out this project at the same time by
            advancing with each person's knowledge.
            Although some are more at ease with programming, each one tries at his own level to make the project viable
            and deliver a website with high expectations.
